# Unix-File-System
We created a file system where files are implemented using multi level indexing. We implemented several functions such as creating a file, deleting a file, renaming a file, writing to a file, listing all files in a directory, creating a directory, deleting a directory, changing directory. This project was built from scratch using c++.
